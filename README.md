# A-Simple-File-System-Simulator
SimpleFS is a basic file system simulator developed in C for Linux environments. It uses only low-level system calls (open, read, write, lseek, close, etc.) without relying on high-level C library functions. The system allows users to perform essential file operations such as creating, deleting, reading, writing, listing, renaming files, as well as backing up, restoring, and defragmenting the virtual disk. Additional features include integrity checking, logging, and basic terminal utilities. This project was developed as a practical way to understand core concepts of system programming and file system architecture.
